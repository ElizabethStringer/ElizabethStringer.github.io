A.	Personal Statement
I came to SMU Guildhall with over 12 years’ experience in project management and business development in the games industry. After graduating from USC, I began making games and have shipped over 30 titles in my career. I helped grow an independent development company, led internal studios for publishers and have expanded many top franchises with external development.
 
I started my career as a Producer at an independent developer, Xatrix Entertainment, and created games for the PC and LBE (Location Based Entertainment). As Executive Producer at an internal studio of games publisher Activision, I worked on many franchises such as Zork, Star Trek and Heavy Gear. I also served as Director of Development for Atari on some of their most successful original and licensed properties including Blue’s Clues, Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer and the Backyard Sports franchise.
 
In my role as a faculty member, I continue to consult as designer and content creator for educational games that have received funding from the Department of Education, National Science Foundation, and DARPA on varied topics including math instruction, teacher training, and leadership and conflict resolution. I am currently working extensively in the field of VR/AR to develop projects for both the SMU Department of Psychology and the SMU Simmons School of Education and Human Development.

In my role as program administrator, I am charged to sustain the growth of the gaming industry and create its future leaders. SMU students are World Changers, and at SMU Guildhall we are the genesis of Game Changers that have been shaping the game industry for over16 years. Guildhall has achieved a #1 ranking and maintains the lead amongst its competitors because of its consistent scope and scale over time. Since 2003, when SMU Guildhall began with its first cohort of 32 students, hundreds of institutions have added game studies to their course and degree offerings.  Our differentiation is that the game development education knowledge is applied broadly and spread via our alumni with a 90% placement rate. SMU Guildhall built a model of excellence that has provided over 900 students and alumni with the skills and abilities quickly rise to senior and leadership roles.  We provide all graduates with the equivalent of two years of team game industry experience. I mentor students of all disciplines and model the values of servant leadership. At the core of SMU Guildhall is the interdisciplinary team game projects that artists, designers, programmers, and producers interview for in order to gain team membership and leadership roles. Potential applicants and potential employers point to the quantity and quality of the games created at SMU Guildhall as a top reason for selection of our school and hiring of our students.

2018 – Present Virtual Reality Simulation HABIT Game
My individual research focuses on creating an HTC Vive virtual reality simulation to be used for hand-arm bi-manual physical therapy for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Manipulating the object shape and size with weights is combined with hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy (HABIT) for improving upper extremity function in patients with cerebral palsy.  Using 2 Vive handheld controllers, patients are immersed inside a VR arcade game of Tetris in which the Tetris game blocks are 3D virtual objects to be picked up with both hands via the controllers and rotated into the proper placement to solve the Tetris puzzle. Patients can also design and create their own custom Tetris puzzle blocks by selecting squares with the controllers on 3D gridded "paper" to solve the Tetris puzzle.

E.   Interdisciplinary Research 

2018 – Present Augmented Reality game for Learning Geometry
Purpose: The purpose of this project is to explore how the interaction between collaboration and multisensory experiences, referred to here as collaborative embodiment, affects students' geometric reasoning through the use of augmented reality (AR) technology. This research is significant because theories of embodiment are needed that consider the multi-learner nature of mathematics classrooms and how learners can jointly embody mathematical ideas using different modalities. In addition, recent advances in multi-user instructional technology (including shared holographic AR) allow for new and important hypotheses about collaborative embodiment to be tested. The research team hypothesizes that different modalities for math learning (like a hologram, a set of physical manipulatives, a dynamic geometry system (DGS) on a tablet, or a piece of paper) have different affordances, including the degree to which they can represent dynamic transformations, represent objects and operations in 3 dimensions, support joint attention, and provide situational feedback. Project Activities: Researchers will develop an experimental platform modeled after the Flatland novella that will facilitate data collection from students, situate experimental tasks in an engaging narrative story, and allow for the researcher to control key experimental variables. The overarching research questions that will be explored via this platform are (1) How do different modalities for collaborative embodiment, particularly shared AR, impact student understanding of geometric principles? And (2) how are these effects mediated by gesture, language, and actions, and how are they moderated by student and task characteristics? Products: The research team will generate information about the malleable factors, mediators, and moderators associated with collaborative embodiment in the domain of geometric reasoning.

2014-2017 Virtual Reality Behavioral Simulators 
Decade long cross-disciplinary partnership with the SMU Dept. of Psychology. My directed focused study courses develop Oculus Rift S IVETs and in 2019 added voice modulation capabilities and a participant stress meter UI in a newly animated role-play scenario in order to pilot a study of causal pathways linking race-related stress reactivity and addictive behaviors.  This brings the current total to seven IVETs deployed in behavioral psychology research including role-play scenarios to reach into high-schools and address risky teen behaviors for “The Avatars Project”, and the behavioral research for the “Female Avatar Project” used to assess bystanders' responses when confronted with a situation that could lead to another individual getting hurt, as well as and “My Voice, My Choice” used to reduce the incidence of sexual violence in adolescent girls.

May 1, 2018 - May 2019 Master's Thesis Committee Chair, "Understanding fan loyalty and engagement in esports," Advised: Cole Thatcher 
As investments increase, more research is being conducted to better understand this new ecosystem. Studies on players and live-streaming environments have attempted to understand how streamers and users interact. There is, however, a lack of studies that seek to understand the relationship between fans and their favorite teams and players. Specifically, there is little information on whether fans are more loyal toward a team or a player. Fan loyalty could dramatically change how they engage and financially support their team or player. This study seeks to understand the relationship between fans and their favorite teams and players. Specifically, it attempts to answer two questions: Are fans more likely to financially support teams or individual players? How does player and team identity affect how fans financially invest in teams and players?
May 1, 2018 - May 2019 Master's Thesis Committee Chair, "Factors of Team Performance: The Relationship between Emotional Intelligence, Team Efficacy, Emergent Leadership, and Performance in Video game Development Teams," Advised: Gerald Milton 
Goal: Understanding team performance in video game development teams. Constructs Used: Emotional Intelligence, Team Efficacy, and Emergent Leadership. Research Questions: How does individual emotional intelligence affect performance of teams? How does collective emotional intelligence affect performance of teams. How does team efficacy affect performance of teams? How does the emergence of leadership impact the performance of teams? How does the emotional intelligence of emergent leaders affect the performance of teams?
May 1, 2018 - May 2019 Master's Thesis Committee Chair, "How Power Distance Values Affect Team Trust and Performance on Small Teams," Advised: Hershall Cook
As the video game industry continues to grow, the rising frequency of cross-cultural teams necessitates a deeper examination of how cultural values affect intragroup relations. One of these values, power distance, measures an individual’s belief in and acceptance of an uneven power hierarchy. This study expands upon the existing body of power distance research by examining its effect on team trust and performance on small, newly formed game development teams. In applying a macro construct to a micro four-to-five-person unit, my research primarily seeks an answer to the question of how power distance affects team trust and performance. Additionally, the study explores the effects of team trust on performance as relates to the specific type of group I am studying. Ultimately, the aim is to enable game developers to assemble more effective teams. Hypotheses:
1.High power distance teams will have lower performance scores than low power distance teams.
2.High trust teams will have higher performance scores than low trust teams.
3.Teams with low team power distance and high team trust will have the highest performance scores.
4.Teams with high team power distance and low team trust will have the lowest performance scores.
5.Teams with diverse power distance values among members will have lower team trust and therefore perform worse than those with uniform power distance values.
May 1, 2018 - May 2019 Master's Thesis Committee Chair, "Use of Machine Learning in Analyzing Steam User Reviews to Predict Trends in Topics over Time," Advised: Xia Hua
The goal of this study is to use machine learning to help video game development teams process, and digest feedback from Steam user reviews more easily. To do so, this study will examine the pros and cons of different approaches and build an artifact to analyze reviews of a chosen game from the Steam marketplace. The artifact program will analyze topics of user feedback and highlight trends in the data. This research will provide a new methodology for the game industry to help teams get timely and accurate feedback from their users, which are crucial to the success of their game. Hypothesis 1: Topic models can analyze the reviews of online game publishing platforms and generate meaning patterns for developers. Hypothesis 2: Tracking the trend of a topic in the reviews can reveal player’s experience with the new and changed content updated in the game. 

Students were the recipients of a donor funded Dynamixyz Markerless Facial Motion Capture software and support subscription with a head-mounted camera to control an in-game character.  One set of research determined a human actor could control a non-humanoid, non-anthropomorphized character. Another set of research demonstrated a humanoid character driven by a live actor in a Unity based game in real-time.

Lui, P., Pham, S., Stringer, E., & Jouriles, E., (submitted to Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology). Effects of Racial Discrimination on Stress and Alcohol Craving: A Registered Report of a Virtual Reality Experiment. Upcoming Special Issue: Innovative Theory and Methods for the Next Generation of Diversity and Inclusion Sciences.  
Objectives: People of color experience disproportionately more adverse effects of alcohol (mis)use than Whites. Racial discrimination experiences contribute to health disparities and minority mental health. Yet, existing investigations have yet to differentiate the psychological effects of experiences with major discrimination and microaggression events. Despite statistical advances in accounting for possible key confounding factors and temporal ordering, causal pathways via which discrimination-related experiences affect alcohol craving remain unclear. Using simulations and real-time role-playing in immersive virtual environments (IVEs), the present registered report will summarize an experimental study that will characterize the impact of major discrimination and microaggression experiences on stress and negative emotions, and alcohol craving. The study also will delineate the pathways by which discrimination-related experiences cause changes in urges to drink via stress appraisal and negative emotions. Method: Community adults and college students of color (expected N = 176) will participate in a baseline-control IVE simulation of a social interaction. Participants will be randomized to major discrimination, microinsult, microinvalidation, or stress-control conditions in an experimental IVE simulation. Their stress, negative emotions, and alcohol craving associated with each IVE simulation will be assessed in real time. Analyses of variance and regression analyses will be used.
Lui, P., Jouriles, E., & Stringer, E. (submitted to Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology). Advancing Knowledge on the Health Consequences of Discrimination: The Potential of Virtual Reality.
Objectives: Racism and discrimination drive racial and ethnic health disparities, and are robust markers for a host of health outcomes in people of color and indigenous peoples (POCI). A comprehensive understanding of possible causal pathways by which racism and discrimination lead to POCI’s health disadvantages is a critical step toward promoting health equity. Traditional observational research and laboratory controlled experimental research are limited in balancing the importance of internal and ecological validity. We propose that researchers consider using virtual reality (VR) to advance discrimination science. Method: We summarize current findings on health effects of discrimination and common methodological approaches that have been employed to generate these findings. We describe the limitations of some of the commonly used methods and provide arguments for the potential benefits of using VR to advance discrimination science. Results: VR can be used to facilitate ecologically valid experiments that examine individuals’ responses to racism and discrimination related experiences in real-time. Conclusions: VR offers scientists an innovative method that circumvents some of the problems of commonly used research approaches for examining the effects of racism and discrimination on health.
