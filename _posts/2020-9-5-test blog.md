Journalism in the Age of Data Review

McGhee, Geoff, 2011. Journalism in the Age of Data, available at Vimeo (http://datajournalism.stanford.edu/) in a video book format

Journalism in the Age of Data contains selected segments from interviews about the next century’s journalist discussing information visualization. The video book subject emphasis is on recent trends of democratizing data with narrative around the completeness of data, transparency of data, and accessibility of data.

Fernanda Viegas, Research Scientist at IBM, introduces the foundation that humans are naturally programmed to understand visual information. Steve Duenes of the NY Times sets the framework for illustrating how journalism is using data visualization today that is different from what it was doing in the past. Ben Fry, Design and Software Consultant, opens up the position that there is a move for data to be more about art more about writing.  J. Paige West of MSNBC.com and Scott Byrne-Fraser of BBC both advertise the new database journalism careers that are being created.

One example across multiple chapters is Amanda Cox of the NY Times. Her conversations around innovation to graphical presentations of quantitative data using R and algorithms from her academic world training with using journalist techniques with Flash code for interactive presentations describe her journey to learning to sketch with data as a professional journalist. Her stated goal is to change what you think about the world with her information graphics. Jeffrey Heer of Stanford University advocates for the appropriate understanding of the data by bringing in multiple data sources into one graphic in order to give a context and narrative of the data. Nigel Holmes, a careered graphic designer, sounded the usual alarms about bad visualizations and graphic design being in the hands of untrained individuals, but even he highlights the ability of interactive web visualization to breathe life into a story compared to the limitations of the printed page.

Jeffrey Heer and most of the experts’ interviews agree data journalism is in its early stages and keeps bringing in new specialists to probe and discover what it is capabilities are. They are leaning how to keep readers engaged and overcome reliance on user effort to interact with data and have assimilated expertise from many fields such as motion graphics to develop guidance for information designer visualizations. Many news organizations reported jumping on other trends as well such as hiring in social scientists, statisticians, and are using data to create breaking news. 

The overall advice given is to learn by making and many of the data visualization techniques, tools, information sites, conferences, and research sites are highlighted in the interviews.  John Grimwade of Conde Nast characterized it as a cult trend right now, but he hopes to see it evolve to be more informative in the future. The takeaway is to keep putting out examples to show the types of visualizations that are possible so that lessons in refinement and engagement can be adopted by a wider set of fields.
