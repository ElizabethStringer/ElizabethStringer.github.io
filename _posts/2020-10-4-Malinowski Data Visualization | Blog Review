Bach, Fuge in A minor, BWV 904
Data Visualization by Stephen Malinowksi

Stephen Malinowski's data visulization video of Bach, Fuge in A minor contrasts two distinct visualization styles of the same instruments, one lines with circles and the other rectangles. Each arranged on a scrolling background as the music is played.

Each instrument has it’s own continuous line color with corresponding colored filled circles. The line height equals pitch and the circles are notes. The higher the line, the higher the pitch. The larger the circle, the longer the note is held. The scrolling background follows along the instruments are they each are played. Every note being played is highlighted and then it’s circle is left empty after it is played.  This “used up/empty” visual metaphor is easily understood, as are the flashes of the circles when being played in real-time. The time progression of the line is very easy to follow with it’s directional slopes indicating pitch, or sheet music notation.

The visualization with the rectangles is not as quickly processed and some information is not conveyed. Every instrument has their own vertical location on the screen and is color coded. Each rectangle is placed according to pitch height in sheet music notation and the length of the rectangle indicates how long the note is being played. Even though the current note is highlighted when played, the rectangles are always filled, drawing the attention of the viewer where it should not be.
