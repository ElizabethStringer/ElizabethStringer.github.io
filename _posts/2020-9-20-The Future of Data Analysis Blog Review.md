Review of The Future of Data Analysis
9/20/2020

Edward Tufte's talk at the Microsoft conference on Machine Learning and Data Sciences was a master class for data scientists. He reaches back to inspiration from the published writings of Galileo and find modern practices in film creation. 

Today's data visualizations are capable of high-resolution. Some tips include using light colors to avoid optical clutter and quantifying type. But the tips are not the heart of his message.

Data scientists should as professionals have an open mind but not an empty head. This is serious work and quotes other that characterize anyalzing human behaviour is harder than rocket science. Data scientists should be problem-oriented with their only goal is to learn the truth. Tufte warns, do not fool yourself. He quotes Daniel Patrick Moynihan "you can have your own point of view, you can't have your own facts." His suggestion is to begin your day right away with your work and look at the real world.

The future of data analysis is in a replication crisis and Tufte suggests establishing a data forensics industry to verfiy findings. He quotes Bill Gates, "reall artists ship".

Tufte leavs us with 2 estions to ask ourselves as data scientists: How do I/you/they know that? and How does what I see come to be seen by me?
