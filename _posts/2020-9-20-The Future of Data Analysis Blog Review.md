Review of The Future of Data Analysis
9/20/2020

Edward Tufte's talk at the Microsoft conference on Machine Learning and Data Sciences was a master class for data scientists. He reaches back to inspiration from the published writings of Galileo and finds modern design practices in film creation. 

Today's data visualizations are capable of high-resolution. Some of Tufte's tips include using light colors to avoid optical clutter and quantifying type. But the tips are not the heart of his message.

Data scientists should, as professionals, have an open mind but not an empty head. This is serious work and he quotes others that characterize anyalzing human behaviour as harder than rocket science. Data scientists should be problem-oriented with their only goal to be to learn the truth. Tufte strongly warns, do not fool yourself! He quotes Daniel Patrick Moynihan "you can have your own point of view, you can't have your own facts." Tufte's practical suggestions are to begin your day right away with your work and to always look at the real world.

The future of data analysis is in the midst of a replication crisis and Tufte suggests establishing a data forensics industry to verfiy findings. He quotes Bill Gates, "real artists ship".

Tufte leavs us with two questions to ask ourselves as data scientists: "How do I/you/they know that?" and "How does what I see come to be seen by me?".
